### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work as a Frontend Developer, but work on all sorts of stuff on the side.


#### Some of my projects:

[Valve Source Viewer](https://vsource-viewer.web.app/) - Instantly View Models from CS:GO, Portal 2 and many other Source games.  
[Emote Editor](https://emote-editor.web.app/) - A simple image editor to export all needed resolutions of Emoticons from a single image.  
[Concept Board](https://conceptpanel.web.app/) - A little buggy whiteboard style canvas to easily collect images.  
[OBS Flat Dark Theme](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/flat-dark-theme.616/) - A flat dark theme for OBS Studio. (20k downloads)
