// Written version of the Rive Academy.

Usually, when crating designs for the web. The work always gets done twice.
Once the designer creates a design, that went through many iterations and revisions, then the developer has to recreate it in code.
Once chiselled out in code, making big changes to the design comes with a lot of work.
When creating a teaser card for a blog post, that is not such a big deal.
But with more ambitious animations for example. Changes to the design can be very time consuming.

With rive, that problem becomes almost invisible. Designers and developers can work in parallel and the design can, almost completely, be changed at any time.
This enables us to create more ambitious designs and animations.

## Why Rive?

Rive is not the first, but its different.
