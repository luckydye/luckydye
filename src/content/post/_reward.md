There are people that work, and then there are people that live.

Some may say you cant be successful at both. But I think they are the same thing.

In our capitalist world, we work to make a living.

For work to not become a burden on yourself, we need to understand how we feel rewarded.

Work for me is not just about money. Work for me is something that can fuel my reward system.

Sometimes I can't come up with things I want to do or create. But there is always my job, its purpose is to keep me busy. And if you communicate the things you want to work on, it will make you feel rewarded without you needing to look for things to do yourself.
