This is a list of some of the random tools you find,
and start to use in every project you are working on,
simply because they are that useful.

## Bash (aliases, binds and scripts)

This is not mentioned often enough in my oppinion.
Take the time and make alises and scripts for tasks you do multiple times a day.
Those couple of seconds you waste during typing the same commands stack up fast.

And just in genreal you should probably learn some bash and GNU tools.

## Taskfile

Highlights and good to knowns.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
